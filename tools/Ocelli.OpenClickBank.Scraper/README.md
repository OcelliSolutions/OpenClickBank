# Open:ClickBank Scraper

**Only for use while developing the OpenAPI specification.**

The scraper utility can be used periodically to capture any changes in the official ClickBank API documentation. This can aid in identifying if the Open:ClickBank project needs to be updated and where. In the future, results may be used to generate code through the use of T4 Templates to aid in validating that all endpoints and structures are mapped.

## Usage

Just build and run the application. The paths are designed to write the output to the correct folders by using relative paths.
