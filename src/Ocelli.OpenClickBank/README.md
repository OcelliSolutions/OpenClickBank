# Open:ClickBank

The creation of an OpenAPI spec for ClickBank is only half the challenge. That is to empower non-C# developers to more easily integration with ClickBank. 
For the .NET developers in the world, Open:ClickBank also has a package on NuGet that takes care of all the authentication, rate limiting, and special cases of the API. This is that application.

# Installation

```csharp
builder.Services.AddClickBankServices();
```
